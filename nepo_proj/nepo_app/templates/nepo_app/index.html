        <h1>Nepotism in Hollywood</h1>
    </div>
    
    <p>There’s a new trend on the rise--unearthing and exposing nepotism babies. For the uninitiated, nepotism babies--or nepo babies--is a term used to describe children of famous or affluent parents à la Jack Quaid (son of actors Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan), Elon Musk (son of model Maye Musk), and Margaret Qualley (daughter of actress Andie McDowell).</p>

    <p>The trend is not without the usual symptoms of a cultural chokehold--<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nepobaby?lang=en">#nepobaby</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nepotismbaby">#nepotismbaby</a> have collectively amassed more than 100 million views on Tik Tok, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=nepotism%20baby">google searches</a> for ‘nepotism baby’ have surged this year, and the topic has spawned a number of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvWgFE6NubU">youtube</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS00kOMbQKE&t=579s">video</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq5JPPIzZ08">essays.</a> Discoveries of nepo babies are met with a host of emotions: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rockstarluvvr/video/7064218875931495685?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en">admiration</a> (even for <a href="https://twitter.com/mikesmicYT/status/1488185254695227397">unborn nepo babies</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/meriemistired/status/1495548990926041094">surprise</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tnndynamite714/video/7036564601097571590?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1">exasperation</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chemistryluvr/video/7030888219155631365?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1">derision</a> and perhaps a sprinkle of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@amelia__woodward/video/7087275729003777326?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1">envy.</a></p>

    <p>The fascination with nepo babies, however, contributes to the larger dialogue on social justice and equality. These Tik Tok and Twitter exposés reflect a disillusionment with the idea of meritocracy (specifically in Hollywood) and unveil a system that seems to consistently reward privileged candidates; nepo babies are able to leverage connections, exposure, and financial privilege not necessarily afforded to their peers.</p>

    <p>So, just how pervasive are nepo babies in Hollywood? Let’s take a look :)</p>

            <div class="step" id="step1">I collected data on the top and most popular TV and films from IMDb (yes, Rotten Tomatoes is better but the site has less info). For each title I collected the names of the ‘Top Cast’ members from IMDb. The top cast includes the top 18 cast members. I did not collect all the cast members from IMDb as this list included minor roles and extras.  After removing duplicate titles that appeared in multiple lists we were left with { } titles split between { } films and { } tv series.
            </div>

            <div class="step" id="step2">{ } films and { } tv series had at least one person in their top cast who is a nepo baby. You can scroll over the boxes to see which cast members.
            </div>

            <div class="step" id="step3">But some casts were a bit more bloated with nepo babies than others: topping the list is The Grand Budapest Hotel  and Pride and Prejudice (1995 version) each with a whooping 11 cast members (out of the 18 sampled) who are nepo babies. Avengers: Infinity War and Arrested Development tie for second spot, each had 8 nepo babies in their cast.
